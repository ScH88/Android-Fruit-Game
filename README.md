# Android-Fruit-Game
A short, simple but untested game I made with the help of a Youtube tutorial. The objective is to collect all the fruit that drops down using your basket. You can move the basket using buttons or dragging it. Collecting fish and turds reduce the score, and collecting the bottle of poison is an instant game over.

All graphical assets are made using Paint.net. Audio assets are unavailable, as I do not know where to find any.
