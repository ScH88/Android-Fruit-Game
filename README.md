# Android-Fruit-Game
A short, simple game I made with the help of a Youtube tutorial. The objective is to collect all the fruit that drops down using your basket. You can move the basket using buttons or by dragging it. Collecting fish and turds reduces the score, and collecting the bottle of poison is an instant game over.

All files here were extracted from my "AndroidAppProject" base project file > app > src, as uploading all Gradle/Build files was not necessary. The app was built from a empty layout upon setting up the new project.

All graphical assets are made using Paint.net. Audio assets are unavailable, as I do not know where to find any.

NOTE: As my android app emulator is very poor (either that or my laptop being too slow to run it), I do not know if this project is fully functional. Any help would be much appreciated.
